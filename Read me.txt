Hello,

I didn't really know how to present the algo results, so I made a basic GUI to play with numbers.
You just have to fill in the input and let yourself be guided by the buttons.

The function allowing to increment an array of digits and the associated algo are in the incrementTools.js file and is called IncrementArray (digitsArray).
(It is on line 17).

To get straight to the point, here they are copied/pasted :

//////////////////////////////////////
// The requested increment function //
//////////////////////////////////////
function IncrementArray(digitsArray){
    //Algo :
    //► If the last digit isn't 9, this is a simple increment of it
    //► Else, we have to check if the previous digit isn't 9
    //►► While the tested digit is 9, we have to check the previous digit
    //►►► If the tested digit isn't 9, increment it, set all the next digits to 0 and exit the loop
    //►►► Else If the very first digit is 9 (in fact, if all digits are 9, like [9,9,9]), we have to set all digits to 0, unshift a 1 at the start of the array and exit the loop

    var arrayLength = digitsArray.length;

    //► If the last digit isn't 9, this is a simple increment of it
    if(digitsArray[arrayLength - 1] != 9){
        digitsArray[arrayLength - 1]++;

    //► Else, we have to check if the previous digit isn't 9
    }else{
        //►► While the tested digit is 9, we have to check the previous digit
        for(var i = 1; i <= arrayLength; i++){
            //►►► If the tested digit isn't 9, increment it, set all the next digits to 0 and exit the loop
            if(digitsArray[arrayLength - i] != 9){
                digitsArray[arrayLength - i]++;
                for(var y = 1; arrayLength - i + y < arrayLength ; y++){
                    digitsArray[arrayLength - i + y] = 0;
                }
                break;

            //►►► Else If all digits are 9, we have to set them to 0, unshift a 1 at the start of the array and exit the loop
            }else{
                if((i == arrayLength) && (digitsArray[0] == 9)){
                    for(var y = 0; y < arrayLength ; y++){
                        digitsArray[y] = 0;
                    }
                    digitsArray.unshift(1);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return digitsArray;
}
